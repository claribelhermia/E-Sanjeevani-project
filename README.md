# E-Sanjeevani-project
Automated the E-Sanjeevani application using voice recognition in English and Tamil for making telemedicine available for even the illiterate rural people in remote areas.
This was a group project that me and my team worked in for Smart India Hackathon 2023. 
I had lead this project during my second year of my bachelors degree in Computer Science andÂ Engineering.
